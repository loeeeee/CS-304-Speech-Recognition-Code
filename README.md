# Hidden Markov Model for Speech Recognition

This project is an assignment code compilation of CS 304 Course at Duke Kunshan University taught by Prof. Li

The project uses data from TI Dights, an ancient Dataset that contains several thousands of digit sequence recordings from dozens of speakers. Because of the data is recorded before standardized C is even a thing, the included conversation software may not work as expected. Instead, we can use FFmpeg to convert the recordings to modern standards.
